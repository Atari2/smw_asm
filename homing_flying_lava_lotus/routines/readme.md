Almost none of this whole folder was made by me.
This is a mixture of Darolac's flying lotus, which is publicly available on smwc here: https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=20527
and of Erik's homing lotus which is publicly available here: 
https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=20655
So ALL credits goes to them.
This sprite for all intents and purposes is a flying AND homing lotus with pollen, it needs all the routines and stuff that are in the folders.
